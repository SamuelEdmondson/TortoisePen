        <p>This is my portfolio! It is comprised of two main assignments.</p><p>The first is  <em>tortoise feeding frenzy</em>. </p>
        <p>Tortoise feeding frenzy meets several of the requirements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Graphics that respond to click events:</em> Click around to feed the tortoise! You can click multiple times to spawn more food.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Actions that take time to unfold:</em> The Tortoise takes some time to get to his food! He will angle himself and move his arms and shell as he moves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Many objects moving at once:</em> The tortoise is comprised of many objects that move together as he travels to his food pellets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Sets of graphical objects that come and go</em> The food pellets come and go depending on whether or not they have been eaten yet!
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Sets of graphical objects that come and go</em> The food pellets come and go depending on whether or not they have been eaten yet!
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation</em> The tortoise uses Math.sin() to move his arms and legs. These are offset so that all of his legs are not completely synced up and that each "corner" leg moves one at a time. When 
            a food pellet is placed, the unit vector pointing in that direction must be calculated and the tortoise is rotated accordingly. State machine logic is used for the tortoise's arm and shell movement so when he is idle he stops moving.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Multiple animated hierarchical objects</em> All of the tortoises components move relative to the it's base node (even the shell, notice how it wiggles as he moves?). The hierarchical design is also seen in the code itself, where composition is used.
            The `Tortoise` class has `Paw`, `Head`, `Tail`, and `Shell` attributes that are all drawn on the screen relative to the Tortoise's position.
        </li>

        <li>
            <em>Use of basic transformations</em> Scale, rotate, and translate are all used for the components that make up the tortoise. For example, a scale of (-1, 0) is used to flip each of his opposite legs to the mirrored axis in order to reuse that component (notice, he only has "two" legs 
            in his class description, despite the fact he has 4!). The entire tortoise is scaled up since I felt the original design size was too small (very handy!). Rotate as you would guess is used to rotate his arms and the entire coordinate system of the tortoise, and translate is used to move both the entire tortoise as well as the subtle shell wobble as he moves.
        </li>
    </ol>
